        <h1>About Mahatma Gandhi</h1>
        <p>
            Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi[pron 1] (2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948) was an Indian lawyer, 
            anti-colonial nationalist and political ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's independence from British rule.
             He inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. 
             The honorific Mahātmā (from Sanskrit 'great-souled, venerable'), first applied to him in South Africa in 1914, is now used throughout the world..

        <h1>Mahatma Gandhi Born About</h1>
        <p>
            Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat, Gandhi trained in the law at the Inner Temple, London, and 
            was called to the bar at age 22 in June 1891. After two uncertain 
            years in India, where he was unable to start a successful law practice,
            he moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit.
            He went on to live in South Africa for 21 years. 
            It was here that Gandhi raised a family and first employed nonviolent 
            resistance in a campaign for civil rights. In 1915, aged 45, 
            he returned to India and soon set about organising peasants, 
            farmers, and urban labourers to protest against excessive land-tax and 
            discrimination.

        <h1>The MahatmaGandhi Death Of About</h1>
        <p>
            At 5:17 pm on 30 January 1948, Gandhi was with his 
            grandnieces in the garden of Birla House (now Gandhi Smriti), 
            on his way to address a prayer meeting, when Nathuram Godse, 
            a Hindu nationalist, fired three bullets into his chest from a 
            pistol at close range.[184][185] According to some accounts,
            Gandhi died instantly.[186][187] In other accounts, such as 
            one prepared by an eyewitness journalist, Gandhi was carried 
            into the Birla House, into a bedroom. There he died about 30 
            minutes later as one of
            Gandhi's family members read verses from Hindu scriptures.
